CONDITIONAL SOLVER BREAKTHROUGH TEST
======================================================================

Objective: Break through the 1% expressiveness barrier
Hypothesis: Conditional logic + spatial predicates → 10-16% solve rate


📍 PHASE 1: Testing on 'very close' tasks (95-99% accurate)
Starting Phase 1...


======================================================================
TESTING CONDITIONAL SOLVER ON 'VERY CLOSE' TASKS (95-99% accurate)
======================================================================

These tasks were SO CLOSE with diverse solver - can conditionals
break through to 100%?
