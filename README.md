# ARC-AGI Challenge Explorations

This repository contains wild ideas, experiments, and explorations for solving the [ARC-AGI Challenge](https://arcprize.org/).

## About ARC-AGI

The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a benchmark for measuring general intelligence. It consists of visual reasoning tasks that require understanding abstract patterns and applying them to new situations.

## Repository Structure

This is a playground for:
- Novel approaches to pattern recognition
- Creative problem-solving strategies
- Experimental algorithms and architectures
- Unconventional solutions and fun approaches

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute wild ideas! Every crazy idea might lead to a breakthrough.

## Contributing

All ideas are welcome - no matter how unconventional they might seem. The goal is to push the boundaries of what's possible in abstract reasoning.
